# strikeforce-report
This is just a simple HTML graphic, using our regular Bootstrap starter, that usess screenshots from Gov. Abbott's 21CT "strike force" to summarize the report.

### Mobile & social considerations
- because the screenshots are static and the text within doesn't wrap, the screenshots are replaced by `<blockquote>`s of the text on small screens
- the graphics uses our Bootstrap template, which is responsive
- each finding is tweetable, which will hopefully increase sharing
- the listicle format itself is an attempt to increase shareability by creating an easily-digestable version of the report
